Samp. Gregory, on my word, well not carry coals.
Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, well draw.
Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
Greg. But thou art not quickly move to strike.
Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runnst away.
Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the
wall of any man or maid of Montagues.
Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
wall.
Samp. Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are
ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montagues men
from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
Samp. Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought
with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
their heads.
Greg. The heads of the maids?
Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
Take it in what sense thou wilt.
Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.
Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and tis known I
am a pretty piece of flesh.
Greg. Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been
Poor John. Draw thy tool - Here comes two of the house of
Montagues.

Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
Samp. Fear me not.
Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!
Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Abram. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
Abram. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Samp. aside to GREGORY Is the law of our side if I say ay?

thumb, sir.
Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?
Abram. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
Samp. If you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
Abram. No better.
Samp. Well, sir.
Greg. aside to SAMPSON Say better. Here comes one of my
masters kinsmen.
Samp. Yes, better, sir.

They fight.
